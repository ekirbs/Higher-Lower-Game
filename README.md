# Higher Lower Game

## Description

This is my version of the Higher Lower Game!  It began life as a simple assignment in a 2-week course, and it's become a playground of sorts for me to experiment and learn.  I know the Higher Lower Game is a classic Coding assignment, so the goal of this project is to eventually the most streamlined version of the code that I can, but as many fun features and styling as I can find.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Read the instructions on the page.  It will give all the directions.  Once you set the maximum limit, make your guess.

When you guess a number, the button will change colors depending on how far away you are.  The colors are on the rainbow scale.  Here's how it goes:

Purple: You're really far away...
Red: You're far away..
Orange:You're getting close.
Yellow:You're close.
Green: You're really close!
Blue: You got it right!!

TIP:  Once you set a maximum limit, the random number you're trying to guess will be displayed in the console.  If you want to cut to the chase, open the console by pressing "Ctrl +Shift +J (on Windows) or "Cmd + Option +J" (on a Mac)."
